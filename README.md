***## ISC2020 Prime-Adam Number***\
Prime Number : 2, 3, 5, 7, 9...\
Adam Number : The square of the number and the square of its reverse are reverse of each other\
*Example:*\
number = 13 --> (13)^2 = 169\
reverse = 31 --> (31)^2 = 961\
so, 169 and 961 are reverses. Hence 13 is a prime+adam number.\
